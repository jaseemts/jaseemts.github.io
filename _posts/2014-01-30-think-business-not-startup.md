title: "Think Business, Not Startup"
---

Many of us have an idea. And we start working on it and become a ‘startup’. It feels good to build our dream idea.

We all love being a startup.

Once in a while, we get featured on startup blogs. Even national newspapers. We get invited to talk on stage and inspire people. We get entrepreneurship awards. We “check-in” at 5 star hotels. We get angel investment offers. We upload our photo with celebrities and big shot entrepreneurs. We share entrepreneurship quotes on Facebook.

We even have a huge fan following. We’re famous. Wow!

But… How many of us make it to the second year? Not as many as you’d think. A third? Rare. Something must be wrong here.

> As long as we don’t think about making money, it’s not a startup. It’s just an expensive hobby.

Because at the end of the day, it’s all about selling. It’s about getting more customers.

It’s about paying the bills. It’s about surviving. It’s about how well you can balance your expenses and income. It’s about staying in the business. It’s about profitability.

It’s pure business.

Think business, not startup.
