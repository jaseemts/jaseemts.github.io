Most of the people see just a bus.

But there are another set of people. They donâ€™t see just a bus. They see:

- Glass
- Tyre
- Spare parts
- Paint/Body artwork
- Fuel
- The list goes on.

While 99% of the people see just a bus, the rare 1% see business opportunity.

Great entrepreneurs always find new business ideas by observing opportunities in their everyday life.
