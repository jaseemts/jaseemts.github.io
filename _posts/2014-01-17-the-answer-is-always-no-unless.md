We started [WowMakers](http://wowmakers.com) over two years ago in an office that was barely 100 square feet - just enough for the 3 of us who started the company. Without funds, our only option was to start an office in our hometown, a small town near the northern tip of Kerala.

We realized how important it was for us to network with other entrepreneurs if we wanted to scale our business. The only network we had in our hometown were people like the chai-wallah and the guy who ran the mobile recharge shop next door to our office.

We needed help. Help in the form of mentorship, connections and money. And we decided to do something about it. We started emailing some of the people who have walked this road before, who we thought could help us. We told them about who we are, what we do and what are our dreams are.

We asked for help… shamelessly.

> 99% of them never replied. The other 1% changed our lives.

We asked for help. And they helped us.

We received seed funding. We moved to Kochi. We became the first startup to be incubated at [Startup Village](http://startupvillage.in/). We grew from 3 people to 20. We worked with over 150+ clients. We launched our dream product, [CrowdStudio](crowdstudio.in "Design crowdsourcing").

We felt good about our lives.

Remember that 100 sq.ft. office I told you about earlier? We now have a very cool workspace.

All this happened because we asked for help. This is the most important rule for startups. Don’t think too much. Don’t think about what will happen if the other person ignores you.

Unless you ask, the answer is always no.
